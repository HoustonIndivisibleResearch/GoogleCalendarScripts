# GoogleCalendarScripts
This is a collection of scripts created to facilitate the creation and management of a croud sourced google calendar 

This will eventually utilise a google form with a google sheet of responses, a google calendar (or more than one) and potentially other sources for events to make administrating such a calendar as automatic as would be sane.
